# Taco Hell
"Java Edition"

## About
Taco Hell (Codename Cinnabomb) is a game that was created for [Global Game Jam 2019](https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/taco-hell).

This game is an endless runner, with the only goal being getting the highest score.

Java was used to create Taco Hell and I used an old custom game engine that I wrote back in 2019.
